    "## PS1: Optimize the feature set of a rack-mounted M2 MacPro Server\n",
    "The [new MacPro with the M2 Ultra chip has been released](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-pro/rack#). The MacPro M2 has several configuration options broadly organized into five categories: `{CPU, Memory, Storage, Accessories, Software}` with multiple options per category:\n",
    "* The `CPU` category has `2` options. Only one option can be selected from the `CPU` category\n",
    "* The `Memory` category has `3` options. Only one option can be selected from the `Memory` category.\n",
    "* The `Storage` category has `4` options. Only one option can be selected from the `Storage` category.\n",
    "* The `Accessories` category has `3` options. Only one option can be selected from the `Accessories` category\n",
    "* The `Software` category has `2` options. Neither or both options can be selected from the `Software` category\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "Using a `linear` utility model and budget and feature constraints, compute the optimal set of features for a rack-mounted MacPro M2. This problem will be similar to the examples discussed in the lecture and discussion, except for one crucial element: the decision variables (our choices) will be `binary`, i.e., $x_{i}\\in{0,1}$ where a `0` indicates that we do NOT choose feature $i$. In contrast, a value of `1` indicates that we choose option $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, an agent has a set of $n$ configuration options $X = \\left\\{x_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, a `Linear` utility function, and a total of $I$ units of resource to allocate, e.g., money, and potentially other constraints. An optimal agent maximizes its utility subject to its resource and other constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\text{maximize}~\\mathcal{O} &=& \\sum_{i\\in{1,\\dotsc,n}}\\alpha_{i}x_{i} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{subject to}~\\sum_{i\\in{1,\\dotsc,n}}c_{i}x_{i} & = & I\\\\\n",
    "\\text{and}~\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x} & \\leq & \\mathbf{b} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{and}~x_{i}&\\in&{0,1}\\qquad{i=1,2,\\dots,n}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $c_{i}\\geq{0}~\\forall{i}$ denotes the cost of option $i$, $\\alpha_{i}$ denotes user-specified coefficient in the `Linear` utility function, $x_{i}\\in{0,1}$ represents the choice of option $i$, and $\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x} \\leq \\mathbf{b}$ represents additional constraints governing the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List of Tasks\n",
    "* __Task 1__: Specify $\\alpha$- and $c$-vectors for the problem\n",
    "* __Task 2__: Specify the additional constraint matrix $\\mathbf{C}$\n",
    "* __Task 3__: Specify the problem object and solve the problem\n",
    "* __Task 4__: Try at least two different weighting schemes and different budget values, and explore how these design choices influence the optimal configuration (one of these __can__ be the `default` values specified below)."
